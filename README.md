# Chaladni
A project inspired by @ProRedCat
Contains two ways to diplay the chaladni patterns. They allow you to change the frequencies of the notes to observe changes.

The first program is written in processing. @ProRedCat wrote the algorithm but it was black and white and had extremely rounded edges. I decreased the effect of the edges at the cost of major speed. I also added 3d perlin noise to add a cool colour effect. I made it possible to outport the frames to a video because of how slow it was. 

The second program is written in p5 js. Rather than calculating what the pattern would look like given certain settings, this program simulates the wave on a serface. You can change the values of the amplitude, frequency and damping. This program can visulise the wave in terms of position or velocity
